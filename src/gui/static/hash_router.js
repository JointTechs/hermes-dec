// WIP..

/**
 * TODO (2023-04-06):
 * 
 * First, ensure that we correctly copy data onto the disk
 * into "project_meta.py" so that we can reuse it later
 *  a) Display a list of the data in "~/.local/share/HermesDec/"
 *     so that it can be deleted/we do not reupload too much the
 *     same thing (also maybe SHA-256 hash-name files/directory?)
 * 
 * Then, store raw JSON data in the URL hash, in the form of:
 * {
 *    // WIP ...
 * }
 * 
 * Then, read this data on page load correctly so that we can
 * test our changes quickly later
